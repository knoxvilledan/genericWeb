        <h1>Introduction About Me</h1>
        <p>
          I'm passionate about programming and my family. Here's a glimpse of my
          world. CSS test "What kind of boarders can I put on this section?" TBD
        </p>
      </section>

      <button id="hoverButton">Hover Over Me</button>

      <h1>Test 4. Can I have two h1's ? YES</h1>
      <p>
        Test 5.CSS test What can I do with css on this area? between header and
        the div I'm gonna add?. TBD "Test 6." I'm testing the wrap around a
        paragraph here I'm curious if it just keeps going in the direction to
        the right and continue or is it gonna automatically drop down to the
        next line? IT DOES WRAP AROUND BUT NOT ENOUGH. TOO WIDE FOR CONTEXT ON
        PAGE
        <br />
        Possible that css can fix it for me?
      </p>
      <!-- It seems that these areas are just dead page space. Meaning that as I manipulate 
          section ID 's and div classes, I notice that it's this area is not an area that 
          I can easily edit with CSS or JS-->

      <h2>"Test 8." can this go here? YES</h2>
      <p>
        Test 9. i'm not putting a (br) above. A. Does that matter? NOT REALLY>
        IT LOOKS A LITTLE BETTER THAN IN THE HEADER.
        <br />
        <br />
        <!-- this made a huge difference-->
        <br />
        B. CSS TESTCan I use css to fix the potenial spacing problem? TBD
      </p>

      <div class="column">
        <!-- TEST "column test" Alright and in this column class I wanna know if I can put borders around the three columns that I'm setting up.
           I've set these designationson in css.Sure if I need to link in JS yet? 
           There might be a thing i can do. That may be next touch though yeah I tried. 
           alright I got a border around all three columns and I wanna try to get three borders around the three columns next time. 
           Next touch: Do fix the above. And I wanna fool with Flexbox over here as a test next time as well
